Jason's NoSQL Challenge: Social Network API

## Description
 I built an API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friendsâ€™ thoughts, and create a friend list. I used Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database, and the Mongoose ODM. I was able to get able to get the users and thoughts to work in Insomnia; however, the adding and deleting of friends and reactions landed me the dreaded 404 error.
